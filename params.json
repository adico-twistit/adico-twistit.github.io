  "body": "### Welcome.\r\nI decided to add up some notes & share my latest experience with the technology stack of:\r\n* Titan Graph DB 1.0.0 with DynamoDB as backend\r\n* Gremlin-Groovy using Gremlin Server\r\n* Wrapped by an API Layer made of Loopback under NodeJs \r\nWhich I used to execute social features over REST API (i guess it will be) focused mainly on titan graph DB. \r\n\r\n### Downloads & References\r\nThe setup is easy and consisting of a few steps:\r\n1. install dynamo db locally\r\n2. install titan 1.0.0 with dynamo as backend\r\n3. for API i used loopback over nodeJs which provided easy to setup API framework\r\n\r\n### Versions, Downloads ... References\r\n[Running DynamoDB Locally](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.DynamoDBLocal.html)\r\nMostly what this docs say is download unpack and run the java server (need Java 1.7(#TODO: maybe 1.8 need to check) and above)\r\n\r\n[The Amazon DynamoDB Storage Backend for Titan 1.0.0](https://github.com/awslabs/dynamodb-titan-storage-backend)\r\nAgain, mostly what this docs say is download unpack and run the java server (need Java 1.7(#TODO: maybe 1.8 need to check) and above)\r\n\r\n[Yet Another how to install by AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.TitanDB.DownloadingAndRunning.html)\r\n\r\n[From Local to Production - Some Settings you might need](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.TitanDB.Storage.DDBLocal.html)\r\n\r\n[Titan Graph DB Referece](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.1.1-incubating/reference/)\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nInstalling DynamoDB Localy\r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Tools.DynamoDBLocal.html\r\n\r\nRunning DynamoDB Localy\r\nmvn test -Pstart-dynamodb-local\r\n\r\nRunning gremlin server\r\nbin/gremlin-server.sh ${PWD}/conf/gremlin-server/gremlin-server-local.yaml\r\n\r\nRunning gremlin console\r\nbin/gremlin.sh\r\n  \r\n### Final Notes \r\nYAY!! At this point you should have a running gremlin console!!   \r\nready to shot commands to your titan server.\r\n[Follow this link to the Wiki] (https://github.com/adico-twistit/adico-twistit.github.io/wiki) where i'll constantly add more and more pages regarding different issues I faced with the mentioned technology stack.
